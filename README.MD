# Python Learning Projects

Hi, I’m Callum 👋  
I’m a junior-level Python developer focused on building strong fundamentals through practical, hands-on projects.

This repository contains a collection of Python projects I’ve built while learning core backend concepts such as file handling, object-oriented programming, and SQL.
